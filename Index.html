            <p>My favourite hobby is Coding and Robotics as it is very interesting with numerous bunches of Knowledge about real-life objects. we could create amazing things from programming.Whenever I am free, I start my PC and create projects related to robotics and programming. I have also started publishing my apps and games on Playstore.
            
            My robots and robotic projects are selected for exhibitions like Ignited Minds Expo 2019 and 2020.I am also thinking of creating a robot that could help my mom in some of the household works like cleaning and serving.I have also started my Youtube channel where I show my projects and tell how to create it.I have been learning coding from 1 year and robotics for almost 2 years. My Youtube channel's name is Techie Param.</p>

            <span><h2>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</h2>
            <p>
You know he must be important when he has a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II. Well, Sir Timothy Berners-Lee only had a hand in the invention of the internet as we know it.

He originated the concept of, and created, hyperlinks and hypertext which can also be seen as the http and html in your browser addresses. Using these, Tim Berners-Lee invented the internet-based World Wide Web, enabling data sharing worldwide.

The internet – and world – today would be very different without his work.</p>
                
                <h2>Grace Hopper and Dennis Retchie</h2>
                <p>
In 1952, Grace Hopper became the inventor of the first compiler (software that translates one programming language to another). This allowed programmers to use near-English instead of machine code.

No longer did early programmers need to translate everything into binary. Grace’s work paved the way for the development of higher level programming languages, like that created by Dennis Ritchie.

Dennis Ritchie created the C programming language, otherwise known as ‘the mother of all programming languages’. C is the most widely used programming language to date, and is still taught in computer science programs today – almost half a century after its conception.</p>
